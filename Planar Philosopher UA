		"The gods are frauds; the unknowable truth lies beyond the veil. (Athar)",
		"All life springs from the same divine source, ascending and descending in form as the cosmos tests it. (Believers of the Source)",
		"The multiverse ain’t supposed to make sense; there’s no grand scheme, no deep meaning, no elusive order. The only truth worth finding lies within. (Bleak Cabal)",
		"Entropy is ecstasy; decay is divine. The verse is supposed to fall apart. We’re just here to keep leatherheads from interfering. (Doomguard)",
		"We’re all dead - some more so than others. So, we explore our current state with patience, purge our passion, and ascend toward the purity of True Death. (Dustmen)",
		"The multiverse belongs to those who seize it No one’s to blame for a poor sods fate but the sorry sod himself. (Fated)",
    "Everything has laws; most are dark. Learn the laws of the multiverse and you can rule it. (Fraternity of Order)",
    "This ain’t no faction, and nobody tells us what to do. Keep your options open; nobody’s got the key to the truth. (Free League)",
    "Peace is our goal. But if it takes a little war to get others to set things right, the Harmonium way, so be it. That’s how we’ll reach our golden harmony. (Harmonium)",
    "Justice is everything. When properly applied, punishment leads to perfection. (Mercykillers)",
    "The status quo is built on lies and greed. Crush the factions. Break ’em all down and rebuild with what’s left - that’s the only way to find the real truth. (Revolutionary League)",
    "The multiverse exists because the mind imagines it. The Signers - it could be any Signer - create the multiverse through the power of thought. (Sign of One)",
    "To know the multiverse, experience it fully. The senses form the path tom truth, for the multiverse doesn’t exist beyond what can be sensed. (Society of Sensation)",
    "Action without thought is the purest response. Train body and mind to act in harmony, and the spirit will become one with the universe. (Transcendent Order)",
    "Chaos is truth, order delusion. Embracing the randomness of the multiverse, one learns its secret. (Xaositects)"
